# Python Multi-Threaded Port Scanner

A custom network reconnaissance tool built to identify open ports and service versions (Banner Grabbing).

## Features

Multi-Threading: Utilizes Python's threading module to scan hundreds of ports simultaneously, reducing scan time by 90% compared to linear scanning.

Banner Grabbing: Automatically attempts to retrieve the service version (e.g., SSH-2.0-OpenSSH) from open ports.

Socket Management: Implements socket timeouts and exception handling to ensure stability.
